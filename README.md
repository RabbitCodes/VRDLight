Vehicle Routing with Drones - Light Version


This code is used to test an algorithm for Vehicle Routing with Drones (VRD), see arXiv:1705.06431. 
(It works as described in the article, but the OuterSearch is missing.) 
Please note, that it is made for academic purpose only and may not fulfil all coding standards. 

You need to include the metaheuristic framework JAMES (1) - in particular, we used the jars `james-core-1.1`, `slf4j-api-1.7.21` and `slf4j-nop-1.7.21`.
